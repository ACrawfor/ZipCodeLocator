ZipCodeLocator
==============

COM 207 Homework
The purpose of the web page is to display information about zip codes in the vicinity of a point 
clicked on the map. The user first points and clicks on the map. As a result the map marker is 
drawn on the map and the latitude and longitude are displayed in their respective text fields. The 
user can then select the number of items to view using the drop-down menu. Once the “List 
Nearby Zip Codes” button is clicked the table will be populated with information of nearby zip 
codes. Each entry in the table will have the zip code, city name, state, latitude, longitude, the 
distance to the search point and the time difference with respect to the US East coast. Note that 
the selection provided by the user is maintained even after the information is displayed, i.e. the 
map marker, lat/lon information and the “items per page” information are all maintained.
